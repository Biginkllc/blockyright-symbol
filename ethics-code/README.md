# blockyright Ethics Code (v0.1)

The blockyright mark is founded on a simple principle:

> **Respect the truth of creative origin.**

blockyright does not depend on lawyers, courts, or government filings.  
It depends on honesty, transparency, and the integrity of publicly-verifiable records.

Below are the foundational ethics that support the blockyright standard:

---

## 1. Respect Provenance

If a work, idea, protocol, or name has been timestamped, hashed, or otherwise verified on-chain:

- Do not claim you created it first.
- Do not conceal, distort, or downplay its origin.
- Do not present it as your own without acknowledgment.

---

## 2. Honor the Originator

When you use or build upon work that is blockyrighted:

- Credit the original creator openly.
- Recognize the timestamp or hash as part of the work’s history.
- Treat the originator’s contribution with the respect you would want for your own.

---

## 3. Use the Mark Honestly

You may place the blockyright symbol on your own work once you have:

- recorded its origin through timestamp, hash, or public verification
- made no false claims about authorship
- agreed to uphold this ethics code

Using the symbol without verification undermines the entire standard.

---

## 4. Do Not Weaponize the Mark

The blockyright symbol must never be used to:

- threaten others  
- mislead the public  
- assert false ownership  
- block legitimate fair use  
- inflate reputation dishonestly

---

## 5. Protect the Commons

The blockyright ecosystem depends on:

- transparency  
- community enforcement  
- public accountability  
- integrity of open records  

When someone violates these ethics, the consequence is reputational, not legal.

---

## 6. Treat Others’ Work as You Want Yours Treated

The creator who honors origin will naturally be honored in return.

---

## Status

This is **v0.1**, the first public version of the blockyright Ethics Code.

As the community and ecosystem expand, this code may evolve — but its core principle will remain:

> **Truth in origin is the foundation of trust.**
