# blockyright Ethics Code (v0.1)

The blockyright mark is backed by a simple, human-readable ethics code.

Core ideas to be expanded here:

1. Do not falsely claim origin of a work that someone else has blockyrighted.
2. Respect on-chain timestamps and hashes as evidence of creative origin.
3. Use the mark honestly on your own work once you have recorded its origin.

Full text to be added in future versions.
