# blockyright Usage Guide (v0.1)

The blockyright symbol represents the verified origin of a creative work,
idea, or project using blockchain timestamps, hashes, or public records.

This guide explains when and how to use the mark properly.

---

# 1. When You May Use the blockyright Symbol

You may apply the blockyright mark to a work once:

- its origin has been **timestamped**, **hashed**, or **recorded** on a public blockchain  
- you are the **authentic creator** of the work  
- you agree to the **blockyright Ethics Code (v0.1)**  
- the record of origin is publicly accessible (directly or indirectly)

Examples of valid origin proof:

- A blockchain timestamp  
- An IPFS CID with creation metadata  
- A GitHub commit history  
- A verifiable publication date  
- A signed message proving authorship

# 2. How to Place the Symbol on Your Work

The blockyright mark may be placed:

## A. **Digital Art / Images**
Bottom-right corner (recommended)  
Opacity 80–100% for ownership  
Opacity 30–40% for watermark style  

## B. **Documents (PDF, TXT, MD)**
Footer or lower margin  
Optionally include timestamp hash or CID below the symbol  

## C. **Websites / Landing Pages**
Place it in:
- Footer  
- About page  
- Metadata section  
- Banner graphics (optional)  

## D. **UD Profile Banners / Avatars**
Light or neon version recommended  
Small but clearly legible  

## E. **GitHub Repositories**
In:
- README footer  
- Documentation pages  
- Example files  

## F. **Social Media Posts**
Place discreetly in corner or caption  
Avoid distractions in content-heavy visuals

# 3. What the Symbol Means When Displayed

Displaying the blockyright symbol signals:

- “This work has a verifiable origin.”
- “The creator is not hiding.”
- “The timestamp and hash speak for themselves.”
- “False claims of authorship will reflect on the claimant, not the creator.”

---

# 4. What NOT To Do With the Symbol

The blockyright mark **must not** be used:

- without an actual timestamp or origin record  
- to intimidate or threaten  
- to restrict legitimate fair use  
- to create a false impression of authority  
- to claim ownership of another person’s work  

Misuse weakens the standard.

# 5. How the Symbol Works With Other Projects

The blockyright symbol may be used with:

- **IdeaTimestamps** — proof of idea  
- **Web3tionary** — new term provenance  
- **Project_1stWB** — transparency + ethics  
- **RandomRain / Stimulusdrops** — fairness protocols  
- **Vintage archives** — provenance layers  
- **UD Domain banners** — identity and trust  

Wherever **origin matters**, blockyright applies.
