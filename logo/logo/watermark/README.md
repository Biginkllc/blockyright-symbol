# Watermark Symbol Variants

This folder will store watermark-style blockyright symbols for use on:

- Vintage photographs
- Scanned documents and letters
- Parables and written works
- IPFS archival images
- Project vault covers

These versions will typically be:

- Transparent PNGs
- Lower opacity (lighter, subtle)
- Positioned for corners or diagonals

Files will be added here as they are created.
