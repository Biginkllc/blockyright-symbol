**blockyright** is a Web3-native provenance mark for creative works, ideas, protocols, and projects that are timestamped and/or hashed on a public blockchain.

Just as ©, ™, and ® signal a claim of rights in the Web2 world, the **blockyright symbol** signals:

> “This idea or work has a verifiable origin on-chain, and falsely claiming credit for it is unethical.”

This repo is the **official home** for:

- The blockyright symbol files (SVG, PNG, etc.)
- The basic ethics code behind the mark
- A simple usage guide for creators, developers, and projects

## What blockyright is (in plain language)

- A visual mark you can place on your work to say:  
  **“This has been timestamped / hashed on-chain. The origin is provable.”**
- A community-driven ethical standard for respecting creative origin.
- A complement to — not a replacement for — traditional copyright and trademarks.

blockyright works especially well with:

- Blockchain timestamps
- IPFS CIDs
- Open-source projects
- Digital art + media
- Domain name concepts and protocols

## What this repo contains (planned)

- `/logo/` — official symbol files (SVG, PNG, light/dark)
- `/usage-guide/` — how and when to use the mark
- `/ethics-code/` — short, human-readable code of ethics
- `/examples/` — sample uses (art, documents, banners, domains)

---

## Status

This is **v0.1** — an early, open, evolving standard.

As the ecosystem grows, this repo can:

- add translations
- include more examples
- link to live projects using the blockyright mark
- connect with Web3tionary and other IFAM/BIGINKDOT initiatives
