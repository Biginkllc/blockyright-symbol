# blockyright Examples Folder

This folder will contain practical examples of how the blockyright symbol can be used in real projects.

Planned examples include:

- blockyright placed on digital artwork
- watermark overlays for IPFS uploads
- document footer examples (PDF, text, parables)
- UD banner usage with neon or minimal styles
- social media usage samples
- GitHub README examples
- vintage photo provenance demonstration

Examples will be added here in later versions of the repository.
